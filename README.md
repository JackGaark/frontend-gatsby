  Frontend Masters: Introduction to Gatsby
</h1>
<h3 align="center">Spend A Full Day Immersed in Gatsby with Jason Lengstorf</h3>

In this workshop, learn to build blazing fast apps and websites with React using Gatsby, a static PWA (Progressive Web App) generator. Over 50% of people will abandon a mobile site if it takes more than 3 seconds to load. Unless you’re willing to give up half of your potential customers, performance is no longer optional on the modern web. Fortunately, there are a lot of tools available to help you build screaming fast websites. Unfortunately, there’s a frighteningly large number of performance considerations, and many of them are easy to get wrong.

## What You’ll Learn

- Learn how to leverage free, open source tools including Gatsby, React, and
  GraphQL to build high-performance websites.
- Deliver an excellent experience to your users by providing only critical
  assets on load and prefetching assets for subsequent page loads.
- Implement performance best practices, such as the PRPL pattern, lazy
  loading assets, and more.
- Learn to build and deploy blazing fast websites in the fraction of time.
- Create websites quickly with performance baked in.
- Deploy your sites for free in minutes with Netlify.
